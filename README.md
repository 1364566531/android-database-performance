[__greenDAO__](https://github.com/greenrobot/greenDAO) is an ORM optimized for Android: it maps database tables to Java objects and uses code generation for optimal speed.

[__EventBus__](https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus) is a central publish/subscribe bus for Android with optional delivery threads, priorities, and sticky events. A great tool to decouple components (e.g. Activities, Fragments, logic components) from each other.

[__greenrobot-common__](https://github.com/greenrobot/greenrobot-common) is a set of utility classes and hash functions for Android & Java projects.
